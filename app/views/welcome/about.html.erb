  <p>We are dedicated to the makers, the creators, the risk-takers.
  We wake up in the middle of the night and furiously write down
  ideas about how to make your online life better.</p>

  <p>When we're not hard at work, we're hard at play - we're the loud
  ones in the bar, and we're always the ones shutting the place
  down. Human communication and collaboration is what drives us,
  and it infuses every feature of gCamp.</p>
